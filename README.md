# node-tray

Another library for rendering a tray icon on Windows. (And it's feasible to support other platforms in the future. Unfortunately, I can only work with Windows at the moment. But PRs are welcome - see also "dev notes" below.)

## Usage

See `example`.

When using a display scale other than 100% on Windows, the tray icon will look a bit soft. This can be resolved by enabling "compatibility setting -> high DPI -> scaling behavior performed by: application" for whatever executable you end up running this with/in. (Or inject a DPI manifest somehow - please let me know if you manage to do that successfully! ðŸ˜„)

## Usage in a prebuilt app

If you want to use something like `node:sea` to publish your app, you have to ship the bindings library (and its dependencies) and `tray.node` alongside the .exe. You can check out [this project of mine](https://github.com/s-h-a-d-o-w/s3-smart-sync) for reference.

## Differences to other projects

- [`ctray`](https://github.com/diogoalmiro/ctray) seems decent - check whether it maybe fits your needs better! It doesn't seem to allow for updating tray items "in place" though. (And initially, it bothered me that it doesn't support MacOS. Now, I'm supporting even less of course. I probably should have just contributed to that project instead of creating this. But it's done and I have to move on...)
- `systray` relies on a precompiled binary - problematic secure-wise: https://github.com/zaaack/node-systray/tree/master/traybin
- `trayicon` relies on a precompiled binary - problematic secure-wise: https://github.com/131/trayicon/blob/80837912e07c453ad39deea70b1fc566aa98faf3/index.js#L16.

## Dev notes

- Ideally use [this cross platform tray implementation](https://github.com/dmikushin/tray) instead of the current one (which originally also supports multiple platforms but is out of date anyway). I've not been able to compile it on my Windows machine.
